I made this project with Laravel 9.52.16  with Breeze and Livewire

I have created user seeder data according to what is in the JSON data (there are 3 users). 
I have also added migrations to this system. Also make sure to enable it. 

This system uses a login function, and make sure you have activated the seeder user data. So you can open other interfaces
The sample user data is as follows (email / password):
1. admin@mail.com / admin123456
2. agent@mail.com / agent123456
3. customer@mail.com / customer123456

For the first interface page (before there is a JSON extension). You can access http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/123456 

For the extend interface page (after adding a JSON extension). You can access http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/extend/123456
